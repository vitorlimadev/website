			<h1>Owning a place on the internet</h1>
			<p>Posted at 2021-08-12</p>

			<p>
				Recently I’ve watched Luke Smith’s <ahref="https: //odysee.com/@Luke:7/internet-landchads-destroy-r*ddit:7">
					video</a> where he talks about his
					project <a href="https://landchad.net/">landchad.net</a>, a website with information on how to setup multiple
					services yourself, and stop relying on external services for everything you do on the internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				I don’t use any social media (besides an account on LinkedIn), but I didn’t have a place to actually speak
				whatever I want without the all-watching eyes of big-tech. This is why I made this blog. To write whatever I
				want, and express my opinions freely.
			</p>
			<p>
				And maybe this might inspire you to do the same, to try building your actual space on the internet. Because if
				everything you have is inside servers from other companies/people, your digital presence relies on their will to
				maintain and deliver your data.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will probably write a lot about technology in here, since this is what I’m thinking about most of the time. I
				hope you enjoy it!
